# A Python Terminal Based Number Guessing Game

## About
This is a simple terminal based number guessing game. The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user will be prompted if their guess is lower or higher than the chosen random number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game ends. If the user does not guess the number correctly, the game ends. The user is then given the option to play again. The users high score (lowest number of guesses) is displayed during replay as well the mean, median, and mode from the saved scores list when the game ends.
